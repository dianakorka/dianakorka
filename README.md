## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was student assistant for data mining & machine learning at UNIL HEC, also for business intelligence and analytics and big scale analytics in 2021-2022.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on a project called statistical methods for causal inference in R during the Summer School at the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, and testing some flexdashboards in R.
